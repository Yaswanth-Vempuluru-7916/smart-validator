To use the Smart Validator in your React application, follow these steps:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Form, Input, Email, Password, Button } from 'smart-validator';

const MyForm: React.FC = () => {
  const handleSubmit = (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
    console.log(Object.fromEntries(formData));
    // Handle form submission logic here
  };

  return (
    <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-white">Sample Form</h2>
      <Input label="Name" name="name" id="name" required />
